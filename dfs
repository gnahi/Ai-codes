DFS
What is Depth First Search?
‐ Depth first Search or Depth first traversal is a recursive algorithm for
searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure. Traversal
means visiting all the nodes of a graph.

Code –
graph1 = {
'A': set(['B', 'C']),
'B': set(['A', 'D', 'E']),
'C': set(['A', 'F']),
'D': set(['B']),
'E': set(['B', 'F']),
'F': set(['C', 'E'])
}
def dfs(graph, node, visited):

if node not in visited:
visited.append(node)
for n in graph[node]:
dfs(graph,n, visited)
return visited
visited = dfs(graph1,'A', [])
print(visited)
